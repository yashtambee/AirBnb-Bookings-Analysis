### Introduction
In order to learn more about the characteristics of the listings, the demand for various kinds of properties, and the variables that affect pricing, this project will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of AirBnB bookings. 
Both AirBnB hosts and guests, as well as politicians and researchers who are interested in the sharing economy, can benefit from the conclusions drawn from this analysis.

### Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on AirBnb listings in a particular city, including features such as the type of property, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price. 
The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values.

### Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used by the project to comprehend the data and spot patterns and trends. 

To depict the distribution of various variables and their correlations, the EDA uses visualisations including histograms, bar charts, heatmapsÂ and scatter plots. In order to find significant variations across sets of observations, statistical tests are also included in the study.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.0
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly

### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the command jupyter notebook to open the jupyter notebook
4. Open the notebook AirBnb_Booking_Analysis.ipynb to see the analysis

### Conclusion
The qualities of the listings, the demand for various types of properties, and the variables that affect pricing can all be learned by exploratory data analysis of AirBnB reservations. 

AirBnb hosts may use these revelations to enhance their listings and pricing tactics, visitors can use them to decide where to book wisely, and politicians and scholars can use them to comprehend how the sharing economy is affecting housing markets.
